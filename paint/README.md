### Kuzzle paint

A simple multi-users painting application using Kuzzle.

This demo is adapted from [Hynda Paint](https://github.com/hydna/hydna-paint) demo, that uses [Kuzzle](http://www.kuzzle.io) with [Kuzzle SDK v1.6.3](https://github.com/kuzzleio/sdk-javascript/tree/1.6.3) insted of [Hydna platform](https://www.hydna.com/).

This demo has 3 versions : 
- [root folder](#) : adapted version using Kuzzle instead of Hydna platform
- [admin](admin) : same as root folder, but with an additional feature to reset what is drawn
- [offline](offline) : base application without online/real-time feature
