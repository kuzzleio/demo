# Kuzzle - Chat Tutorial

This tutorial builds a Real-time messaging web chat application based on Kuzzle's
[Javascript SDK](https://github.com/kuzzleio/sdk-javascript).

You will start implementing a simple single chat room based on Kuzzle
real-time messaging and progressively add some additional features such as
counting the users in the room or adding a multi-room support thanks to
Kuzzle's persistence layer.

The tutorial uses [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/), which handles every 
logical presentation and let us focus on the business code. However, it should
be pretty straight-forward to adapt to another framework if needed.
